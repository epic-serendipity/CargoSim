# Debug and Cleanup Features Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the enhanced debug functionality and simulation cleanup features that have been implemented in CargoSim to address the user's requirements.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Debug Mode Toggle

#### Multiple Debug Levels
- **OFF**: No debug information displayed
- **BASIC**: Essential simulation information (period, fleet size, basic stats)
- **DETAILED**: Comprehensive information including stock levels, operations count, and action logs

#### Debug Toggle Controls
- **D Key**: Primary debug toggle that cycles through levels: OFF → BASIC → DETAILED → OFF
- **F12 Key**: Alternative debug toggle for quick on/off switching
- **Persistent Mode**: When enabled in configuration, debug mode remembers the last level used

#### Debug Overlay Information
- **Basic Level (Level 1)**:
  - Debug level indicator
  - Message count
  - Simulation time (periods)
  - Current period (AM/PM)
  - Fleet size
  - Recent debug messages

- **Detailed Level (Level 2)**:
  - All basic information plus:
  - Stock levels for all resource types (A, B, C, D)
  - Total operations count
  - Actions log entry count
  - Enhanced visual formatting

### 2. Simulation Cleanup When Returning to Main Menu

#### Proper Resource Management
- **Simulation Objects**: All simulation data structures are properly cleared
- **Pygame Resources**: Surfaces, displays, and graphics resources are properly released
- **Memory Cleanup**: Large data structures (actions_log, history, stock, fleet) are cleared
- **Recorder Cleanup**: Recording resources are properly closed and released

#### Cleanup Triggers
- **ESC Key**: Returns to main menu with full cleanup
- **G Key**: Alternative return to main menu
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Cleanup occurs in destructor and when explicitly called

#### Cleanup Methods
- `_cleanup_simulation()`: Cleans simulation state and data structures
- `quit_pygame()`: Properly quits pygame display and clears surfaces
- `__del__()`: Destructor ensures cleanup even if not explicitly called

### 3. Enhanced User Experience

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **ESC**: Return to main menu (with cleanup)
- **G**: Alternative return to main menu
- **F11**: Toggle fullscreen mode
- **D**: Cycle through debug levels
- **F12**: Quick debug toggle
- **SPACE**: Pause/unpause simulation
- **S**: Toggle safe area display

#### Visual Feedback
- Debug overlay shows current debug level and status
- Timestamped debug messages for tracking simulation events
- Color-coded information display (white for basic, gray for detailed, green for messages)

#### Configuration Persistence
- Debug mode settings are saved and restored between sessions
- Debug level preferences are maintained
- User can enable/disable debug mode in the Gameplay tab

## Technical Implementation

### Code Structure
- **Renderer Class**: Enhanced with debug level management and cleanup methods
- **Main Module**: Improved simulation lifecycle management with proper cleanup
- **GUI Module**: Updated to show enhanced debug functionality and keyboard shortcuts

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Cleanup errors don't prevent returning to main menu
- **Logging**: All debug and cleanup operations are logged for troubleshooting
- **Fallback Cleanup**: Multiple cleanup methods ensure resources are released

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Initialization**: Pygame resources are only initialized when needed
- **Efficient Cleanup**: Only necessary resources are cleared
- **Memory Management**: Large data structures are explicitly cleared to free memory

## Usage Instructions

### Enabling Debug Mode
1. Go to the **Gameplay** tab in the control panel
2. Check "Enable debug mode"
3. Save configuration
4. Start simulation

### Using Debug Features During Simulation
1. **Press D** to cycle through debug levels
2. **Press F12** for quick debug toggle
3. **Press ESC** to return to main menu (with cleanup)
4. **Press G** as alternative return to main menu

### Debug Information Display
- Debug overlay appears in the top-left corner
- Information updates in real-time
- Different levels show progressively more detail
- Recent debug messages are displayed with timestamps

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Better Control**: Multiple debug levels for different information needs
- **Improved Performance**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- **Enhanced Usability**: Multiple ways to toggle debug and return to menu
- **Better Feedback**: Clear indication of debug status and level

### For Developers
- **Maintainable Code**: Proper resource management and cleanup
- **Debugging Support**: Enhanced logging and error handling
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time simulation statistics
- **Resource Tracking**: Clear visibility into simulation state

## Testing

All implemented features have been tested and verified to work correctly:
- ✅ Debug mode toggling with multiple levels
- ✅ Alternative debug toggle keys
- ✅ Simulation cleanup when returning to main menu
- ✅ Pygame resource cleanup
- ✅ Memory management and data structure cleanup
- ✅ Configuration persistence
- ✅ Error handling and graceful degradation

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future improvement:
- **Custom Debug Levels**: User-defined debug information categories
- **Debug Export**: Save debug information to files for analysis
- **Performance Metrics**: Additional performance monitoring and statistics
- **Visual Debug Tools**: Interactive debug visualization tools
