# Enhanced Aircraft Animation and Spoke Bar Features

This document describes the enhanced aircraft animation system and improved spoke bar visualization that have been implemented in CargoSim according to the template requirements.

## Overview

The enhanced system provides:
1. **Smooth aircraft movement animation** with proper state machine
2. **Enhanced spoke resource bars** with configurable scaling and animation
3. **Improved visual feedback** for aircraft states and operations
4. **Configurable animation parameters** for customization

## A) Enhanced Aircraft Animation System

### 1) Aircraft State Machine

The system implements a visual state machine that maps simulation states to visual representations:

- `IDLE_AT_HUB`: Aircraft parked at hub, oriented north
- `LOADING`: Aircraft loading cargo (stationary with visual indicator)
- `DEPARTING` → `ENROUTE` → `ARRIVING`: Movement states with smooth animation
- `UNLOADING`: Aircraft unloading cargo (stationary with visual indicator)
- `RESTING`: Aircraft resting (stationary)
- `BROKEN_AT_HUB` / `BROKEN_AT_SPOKE`: Maintenance states (stationary)

### 2) Movement Animation

- **Smooth interpolation**: Aircraft move along straight lines between nodes with ease-in/ease-out
- **Proper heading**: Aircraft rotate to face their destination during movement
- **Staggered departures**: Random delays prevent overlapping aircraft icons
- **Period-based timing**: All animations respect the simulation period structure

### 3) Coordinate System

- All animation runs within the **map rect** (between left/right rails)
- Uses local map coordinates, never raw screen coordinates
- Hub positioned at center, spokes arranged in a circle
- Aircraft positions snap to integer coordinates to prevent jitter

### 4) Multi-leg Operations

- Supports milk runs: HUB → Spoke A → Spoke B → HUB
- Each leg creates a separate animation segment
- Visual state shows current leg only
- Smooth transitions between legs

## B) Enhanced Spoke Resource Bars

### 1) Visual Design

- **Baseline layout**: Bars positioned to the right of spoke labels (S1, S2, etc.)
- **Vertical orientation**: All bars aligned to common baseline
- **Consistent spacing**: Equal gaps between bars for readability
- **Map bounds**: Bars automatically adjust to fit within map region

### 2) Scaling Modes

#### Linear Scaling
- Direct proportion: height = (value / cap) × max_height
- Best for values that stay near their caps
- Provides immediate visual feedback

#### Geometric Scaling
- Compressed scale: height = (value / cap)^γ × max_height
- Default γ = 0.6 (recommended range: 0.3 - 0.8)
- Keeps small stocks visible while preventing tall towers
- Resistant to outlier values

### 3) Dynamic Caps

- **Rolling caps**: Automatically calculated using P75 percentile across all spokes
- **Per-resource**: Separate caps for A, B, C, D resources
- **Smooth updates**: Caps update slowly to prevent jarring changes
- **Fallback caps**: Default design caps when insufficient data

### 4) Animation Features

- **Smooth transitions**: Bar heights animate smoothly between values
- **Configurable duration**: Default 250ms animation duration
- **Minimum visibility**: Non-zero values always show at least 2px height
- **Over-cap indicators**: Small ticks show when values exceed caps
- **Animation toggle**: Can be disabled for performance

## C) Configuration and Controls

### 1) Keyboard Shortcuts

- **B**: Toggle between Linear and Geometric bar scaling
- **A**: Toggle bar height animation on/off
- **G**: Cycle through gamma values (0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8) in Geometric mode
- **D/F12**: Toggle debug overlay (shows detailed aircraft and bar information)

### 2) Debug Information

The enhanced debug overlay (press D twice for detailed mode) shows:
- Aircraft positions, headings, and current segments
- Bar scaling mode and gamma value
- Animation status
- Current resource values and caps

### 3) Programmatic Configuration

```python
# Set bar scaling mode
renderer.set_bar_scaling_mode("geometric", gamma=0.6)

# Toggle animation
renderer.toggle_bar_animation(False)

# Get current configuration
current_mode = renderer.bar_scaling_mode
current_gamma = renderer.bar_gamma
animation_enabled = renderer.bar_animation_enabled
```

## D) Technical Implementation

### 1) Data Structures

- `AircraftSegment`: Represents movement segments with timing and coordinates
- `SpokeBarState`: Manages bar heights, caps, and animation state
- Enhanced state tracking for all aircraft

### 2) Animation Pipeline

1. **State Update**: Map simulation states to visual states
2. **Segment Creation**: Generate movement segments when aircraft change state
3. **Position Interpolation**: Smooth movement along segments with easing
4. **Heading Calculation**: Rotate aircraft to face destination
5. **Bar Updates**: Smooth height transitions for resource bars

### 3) Performance Optimizations

- **Cached calculations**: Spoke positions and aircraft triangles cached
- **Lazy updates**: Bar caps update only when needed
- **Integer coordinates**: All drawing uses integer coordinates to prevent jitter
- **Efficient rendering**: Minimal redraws, optimized surface operations

## E) Testing and Validation

### 1) Quick Test Checklist

- [ ] Start simulation with aircraft at hub
- [ ] Aircraft depart hub with staggered timing
- [ ] Smooth movement along straight lines
- [ ] Aircraft rotate to face destination
- [ ] Resource bars show smooth height transitions
- [ ] Switching scaling modes compresses/expands bars appropriately
- [ ] All elements stay within map bounds
- [ ] Debug overlay shows detailed information

### 2) Test Script

Run `test_enhanced_features.py` to verify:
- Aircraft state mapping
- Bar scaling mode switching
- Height calculations
- Animation toggles

### 3) Visual Verification

- Aircraft icons never overlap during movement
- Bars maintain consistent spacing and alignment
- Smooth transitions without jumps or glitches
- Proper z-ordering (bars under aircraft, labels above)

## F) Future Enhancements

### 1) Planned Features

- **Flight paths**: Visual trails showing aircraft routes
- **Weather effects**: Visual indicators for operational conditions
- **Enhanced state indicators**: More detailed loading/unloading animations
- **Customizable themes**: User-defined colors and styles

### 2) Performance Improvements

- **GPU acceleration**: Hardware-accelerated rendering
- **Level-of-detail**: Simplified rendering for distant aircraft
- **Batch rendering**: Group similar draw operations

### 3) User Experience

- **Settings persistence**: Save user preferences
- **Animation presets**: Pre-configured animation styles
- **Accessibility**: High-contrast modes and screen reader support

## G) Troubleshooting

### 1) Common Issues

- **Bars not animating**: Check if animation is enabled (press A)
- **Aircraft not moving**: Verify simulation is running and not paused
- **Performance issues**: Disable bar animation or reduce frames per period
- **Visual glitches**: Ensure coordinates are snapping to integers

### 2) Debug Tools

- Use debug overlay (D key) to inspect aircraft and bar states
- Check console for error messages and runtime events
- Verify configuration values in debug information

### 3) Configuration

- Adjust `frames_per_period` for smoother/faster animation
- Modify `BAR_ANIMATION_DURATION` for faster/slower bar transitions
- Change `BAR_GEOMETRIC_GAMMA` for different compression ratios

## Conclusion

The enhanced aircraft animation and spoke bar system provides a significantly improved visual experience while maintaining performance and configurability. The system follows the template requirements closely and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
