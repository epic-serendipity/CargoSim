"""Smart aircraft targeting system for CargoSim.

This module implements a scoring-based approach to aircraft routing that:
- Spreads aircraft out rather than dog-piling on the same spokes
- Prefers nearer spokes (lower travel time/cost)
- Chases the best operational payoff
- Is extensible to real time-based movement later
